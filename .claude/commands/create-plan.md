Create a detailed implementation plan for a site change or feature.

1. Read `CLAUDE.md` and `context/` files if you haven't already this session
2. Read `context/current-state.md` to understand what exists
3. Think through what's being requested and how it fits the existing architecture
4. Write a plan to `plans/` as a markdown file with a descriptive name (e.g., `plans/add-portfolio-section.md`)

The plan should include:
- **Goal** — what we're trying to achieve and why
- **Approach** — how we'll implement it, which files change
- **Steps** — numbered implementation steps
- **Considerations** — anything to watch out for (breaking changes, SEO impact, mobile responsiveness, etc.)
- **Open questions** — anything that needs Nick's input before starting

Do NOT implement anything — just create the plan and present it for review.

The user will describe what they want planned: $ARGUMENTS
