Implement a plan from the plans/ folder.

1. Read `CLAUDE.md` and `context/` files if you haven't already this session
2. Find and read the specified plan from `plans/`
3. Follow the plan step by step, checking off each item as you go
4. After implementation:
   - Run `npm run build` to verify the build passes
   - Run `npm run lint` to check for issues
   - Update `context/current-state.md` if the change is significant
5. Summarise what was done and flag anything that deviated from the plan

If no plan is specified, list available plans in `plans/` and ask which one to implement.
