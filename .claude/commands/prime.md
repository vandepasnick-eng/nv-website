Read the full project context before starting work.

1. Read `CLAUDE.md` for project conventions
2. Read all files in `context/` to understand the site's purpose, design decisions, current state, and background
3. Read any plans in `plans/` that are relevant to what we're about to work on
4. Briefly confirm what you've loaded so I know you're oriented

Do NOT make any changes — just read and confirm you're ready.
