Make a change to the live NV Web Design site.

Before making any changes:
1. Read `CLAUDE.md` and `context/` files if you haven't already this session
2. Read `src/app/page.tsx` to understand the current site structure
3. Read any other files relevant to the requested change

Guidelines:
- This is a live business site — be careful and precise
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions (see CLAUDE.md)
- Use the existing Tailwind theme tokens (navy-*, accent-*) for all styling
- Keep the single-file component architecture unless there's a strong reason to split
- After making changes, run `npm run build` to verify the build succeeds
- Run `npm run lint` to catch any issues
- Summarise exactly what changed when done

The user will describe what they want changed: $ARGUMENTS
