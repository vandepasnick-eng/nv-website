# Purpose

## What This Site Is

NV Web Design is a single-page marketing site for a freelance web design service based in New Zealand. The business builds websites for trades businesses — plumbers, electricians, landscapers, builders, painters, roofers, HVAC installers, and similar.

## Who It's For

**Primary audience:** NZ tradespeople who need a website but don't have time to mess around with tech. They're busy on the tools, not sitting at a computer. The messaging is written to be direct, jargon-free, and reassuring.

**What they're looking for:**
- A professional website that makes their business look legit
- Someone local (NZ-based) they can actually talk to
- Fair, transparent pricing with no surprises
- Fast turnaround so they can get on with running their business

## Business Model

Two payment options — same service, different ways to pay:

### Option A — Pay Upfront (best value)
- **Setup:** $1,200 NZD one-time
- **Monthly:** $129 NZD/month
- **Minimum term:** 6 months
- Positioned as: "Best value — save $1,200 over two years"

### Option B — No Upfront (easy start)
- **Setup:** $0
- **Monthly:** $179 NZD/month
- **Minimum term:** 24 months
- Positioned as: "Nothing to pay today — spread the cost"

### What's Included (both options)

**The Build:**
- Custom-designed website (3–5 pages)
- Mobile-friendly and fast-loading
- Contact / quote request form
- Basic SEO setup (Google-ready)
- Domain setup assistance
- Live within 5–7 business days

**Ongoing (monthly):**
- Website hosting, SSL, security updates
- Regular backups and uptime monitoring
- Minor content updates (up to 2 per month)
- Email support — response within 24 hours

### Key Differentiators
- **Ownership:** Domain in client's name, all content/images belong to client, full handover on cancellation — unlike rental competitors
- **Free mock-up:** Homepage mock-up before any commitment, zero risk
- **Speed:** 5–7 business days, faster than every competitor
- **Value prop:** "One job you're losing to a competitor who shows up on Google first covers the entire cost."

## Brand Voice

Friendly, direct, no-nonsense. Speaks to tradies the way they'd want to be spoken to — no corporate waffle. Lead with outcomes (found on Google, more calls) not deliverables (a website). The tone positions Nick as a real person, not an agency.
